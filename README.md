# Ith-mathi üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Codemax


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Achuth Sankar T.S - Viswajyothi College Of Engineering and Technology
- Member 2: Lakshmi Hani - Viswajyothi College Of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
Make the study proccess from multiple pdfs easier.Allow students to generate answers for the questions which they don't know by giving prompt.Uses llama 3.1.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Studying the module which is a continuation of previous module which we didn't refer.This makes it easier to find the answers to the question without refering the full previous one.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
AI teacher combined the pdfs given in as multiple chunks and grabbed the usefull ones.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Python
- Streamlit,llama 3.1
- streamlit,langchain_community.document_loaders,langchain.text_splitter,langchain_ollama,langchain_chromalangchain.prompts
- chatgpt,vs code


# Run
needed pdfs are given in the code during the implementation time.by using "streamlit run test.py" we run the program and user give the prompt  and find the answers.
